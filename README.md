ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NicolaSzabo

I am currently a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Basel, where I am in my 3rd semester. My academic journey has led me to develop a strong interest in medical systems engineering, particularly in the areas of image acquisition and analysis.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare systems, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.
